1. You will need to download and install "Conan", "Cmake" and "Visual Studio 2019".

2. Go to the "tools" folder and double click on the file "build_deps.bat".

3. Wait for the dependencies to finish being implemented, 
	i.e. when the console that has been opened finishes all its processes and closes.

4. In the same folder where we are (tools) we double click on the file "gendeps.bat". Press 'd' whenever it asks if it is a file or directory.

6. Exit to the main directory and go to the "build" folder that was created in the previous steps 
   and open the file "Motor.sln".

7. Select one of the projects, choose at the top if you want to compile it in: 
	"Debug", "Release" or "RelWithDebinfo".

8. Once everything is selected, right click on the project and compile.

9. In the "build" folder, a new folder will have been created with the name of the compiled project,
	inside this folder we will be able to find the different folders depending on how we have compiled the project 
	and inside these folders the executable of the project.
